%s is dedicated! Best pet sitter in Paris because she's kind and a true animal person
Just brought my maltipoo here for a short weekend stay and couldn't be happier!! %s and her family treated my pup like their own. Its a home-setting which is best for my pup as she was abused/neglected at another area kennel and HATES being in a crate/cage.
%s has a lovely home and backyard for the pups to play and toys/beds/bones in every room of the house. Seriously can't beat her prices either!! Highly recommend!
"I would highly recommend %s. She has been pet sitting for a few years and is very reliable, flexible and trusted."
"I wish my dog could write this because her actions speak volumes! Our 7 year old lab-mix, Jacky, knows exactly when we turn off to go to %s and she goes wild with excitement!"
"We had to use our old service at the last minute last holiday season and Jacky did not want to go in. In fact, she tried to drag me back to the car which made me sad to leave her. %s is wonderful with the pets she cares for and definitely spoils them as much as anyone would!"
I cannot recommend anyone else as highly as D Best Pet Sitting and neither could %s!
"My wife and I have been using %s to care for our kids, Pedal and Sprocket for several years. Our puppies run to her front door every time she sits for them."
%s has done an excellent job keeping us informed and sending pictures.
"%s  feeds our saltwater fish, when needed. She is excellent. If you need your pets taken care while in or out of town, Julie is for you. She cares for your animals the way you want them to be taken care of."
"I am new to the Paris area and it took me months before I finally found %s, my forever pet boarding place, with the best pet sitting!"
"%s is by far our first choice when we need a dog sitter. We have used her service on several occasions, the last one for a period of three weeks."
"During the time, %s kept the house neat and tidy and stayed in communication with us on a regular basis, eliminating the stress of leaving the dogs and house behind."
"Above all, %s is trustworthy, and our dogs love her.  We would be happy to provide personal references upon request."
"I highly recommend %s! My two cats received the care and attention they needed, and my house was very well kept! In fact, it seemed cleaner when I returned, than the day I left for our trip.  Laura  is very friendly, trustworthy and dependable. You will not be disappointed!"
"%s has been an absolute blessing!   Cierra  (my dog) loves him and does a happy dance upon her arrival.  She is prompt, reliable, trustworthy and will update me when I’m out of town which is always comforting.  I don’t know what we would do without her!"
I love how %s pays attention to detail.  He wanted to make sure that she knew my little guy: from his treats and his routine down to the way he likes to play ball.  I never worried a minute while I was out of town because she had everything under control.
"It was such a comfort knowing that my little guy didn’t have to go stay somewhere else, but could stay in his own routine at home.  I would HIGHLY recommend %s and her pet sitting services to ALL my friends with furry people."
"Don’t even worry about stressing or planning for a trip to the kennel, just let %s come over and take care of your little family at home.  AND, she will update you as often as you’d like regarding your pets and their behavior.  Call her today!!"
%s with unleashed pet sitters is amazing.
